License Information:

After installing, you will need a license key to run Atlas. 

If you don't have a key already please request a free Atlas Lite license (http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/lite/). It takes less than 15 minutes to get a new license. 
If you are a student, you can get a complimentary 1 year license (named as 'Complimentary Academic license') for Atlas (http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/academic-license/). Takes upto one day to obtain this license.


For a Atlas lite license, it is linked to an email address. So when you try to use 'Atlas smart view' or 'Atlas Connection view' you will be prompted to enter License details which are -
1 License Key
2 Associated email address
3 Username (auto-filled from your system config) [Cannot be modified]

Note: Username is important when you request a 'Complimentary Academic license' and for Atlas lite license, username is not an issue.
