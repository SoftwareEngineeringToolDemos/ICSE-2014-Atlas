Getting Started with Atlas

These following steps help in getting started with Atlas. Before following these steps you must have a project imported to Eclipse.

In this VM, Eclipse is loaded with few sample projects which help you get started with and gain experience with Atlas. Location of projects - /home/skataka/Desktop/workspace. Atlas has no restriction on size of projects but bigger projects take more time for mapping.

- Click the Atlas -> Atlas Smart View menu item.
- Atlas will index your source code, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes for most projects.
- Then click on a field to get a nice graph.
- Atlas also maps graph elements to method declarations, files and variables.

To change the type of graph click on the drop-down item in the bottom left corner of Atlas Smart view and pick a different script. Have fun trying different scripts and clicking in different parts of your code. Clicking on various elements in the graphs takes you to that particular element in the specific file (which has the clicked element).

Atlas also has a Connection View menu item.

- Click the Atlas -> Atlas Connection View menu item.
- Atlas will index your source code, it will take a few seconds to a few minutes for most projects.
- You can add files to 'root' pane and 'leaves' pane
- Atla Connection View gives you a nice graph showing how files in root pane are connected to files in 'leaves' pane. (They can be swaped with arrows present between the panes)
